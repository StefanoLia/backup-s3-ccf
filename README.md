# Backup using S3## Directories* **files**: which contains the files that we want to upload in an S3 bucket;* **keys**: which contains all the files needed to set up the AWS configuration.## Prerequisites* the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python (`pip3 install boto3`);* get the keys from AWS in your Account details. You need AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID, AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY, AWS\_SESSION\_TOKEN keys;* Save these keys in the corresponding file in the "keys" directory;* Create a bucket using the S3 service in AWS;* Save the name of the bucket in the corresponding file in the "keys" directory.## CodeThe script *backup.py* contains the code used to upload the files in the "files" directory to the S3 bucket. Note that the files are uploaded only if they have been changed.To periodically upload files using this script you can use a cron process in an Unix based system.The code does the following things:* Read the files in "keys" directory to set up the session;* read all the files in the "files" directory and store them in a list;* check if the latter files are in the S3 bucket. If they are they are downloaded otherwise they will be uploaded;*  If a file is downloaded it is compared to the file in "files" folder hashing the text inside both. * If the hash is the same they have the same content. Otherwise, the new version is uploaded.
